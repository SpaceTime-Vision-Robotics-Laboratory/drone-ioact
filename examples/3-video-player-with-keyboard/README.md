# Video player on a random video VREVideo (ffmpeg wrapper) using the Drone's I/O data queues & controllers

```bash
python main.py video.mp4
```

Controls:
- `ESC` - closes the window
- `SPACE` - pauses or plays the video
- `->` - skips on second ahead
- `<-` - goes one second behind

This could be used in the future to test the library with to mock a simulator, reading frames from a video, not from an actual drone.
